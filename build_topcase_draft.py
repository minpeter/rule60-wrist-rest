"""Rule 60 V3 HHKB top case + integrated honeycomb wrist rest (stock bottom case, plate, gaskets and ball catches).

Built from caliper measurements of the owner's stock top case plus photo metrology of the silicone gasket caps and
ball-catch pockets (IMG_0201..IMG_0222, 28 px/mm rectified):
  - Silicone gasket cap ("gasket bean/sock", 12 installed = 2 per 41 mm tab):
      * 8.3 mm long x 5.5 mm wide x 4.5 mm free height (1.5 mm top + 1.5 mm PC + 1.5 mm bottom)
      * Total outer span across both caps on each 41.00 mm tab = 43.00 mm (26.2 mm bare tab between caps)
  - CNC order as on the stock part (caliper; top face down = `Z_p 0`, `Z_p` grows toward the skirt lip):
      1. Block with the 6-deg top face + 0.70 mm 45-deg outer chamfer, skirt lip at `Z_p = 20.01 mm` (IMG_0333)
      2. Base pocket from the lip down to the `Z_p = 9.69 mm` floor (IMG_0334) inside the skirt (`2.85 mm` sides and back,
         `2.80 mm` front; `R4.85` outer / `R2.0` inner corners); the stock bottom case nests in this 10.32 mm pocket.
         Outline from the caliper-measured top-face bezels: 5.65 sides, 10.90 back, 11.02 front -> 298.10 x 117.37 mm
      3. HHKB keycap opening through the floor
      4. Plate-body relief + 6 open rounded-rectangle silicone-cap pockets, one level `Z_p = 6.30 mm` (caliper), cut
         straight from the floor inside a `2.05 mm` floor ledge along the skirt (short side: ledge 2.85..4.90 mm and the
         6.30 strip 4.90..5.66 mm from the outer edge, caliper). One pocket per DWG `6095(gas)` tab: the compressed cap
         footprint (`8.2 x 4.0 mm`, two per tab) plus `0.65 mm` room per side (front: up to the ledge), `R1.8` skirt-side
         corners, no wall toward the plate. `R1.0` where a pocket meets the relief, `R0.5` on the relief corners
      5. 4 ball-catch strike pockets cut from the floor to `Z_p = 5.55 mm` (IMG_0337): `7.25 mm` wide for the ~20.5 x
         6.55 mm strike, stock CNC "mushroom" end reliefs (`4.1 mm` semicircular lobe on the skirt half `4.55 mm` past each
         plate end, interior-half end wall `2.15 mm` past it, `R0.85` shoulder; two-view fit of IMG_0218/0222), with
         `3.55 mm` deep M2 strike screw pilots; each keeps its fitted distance to the inner skirt wall it faces
      6. USB-C notch (12.8 wide, 8.7 deep from the lip, R1.5 closed-end corners). Gasket mount only: no top-mount screws.
  - Staggered split into two X2D halves: X = 0 through the wrist rest and front bezel (3 dovetails); the back bezel runs
    on in the LeftHalf to the back-left (BL) strike centre, where the stock strike plate (one M2 per half) and a wedge key
    join the back seam. Each male part keeps its 45-deg print ramp and the female side fills under it, so every joint
    closes over all faces with a 0.20 mm glue line and nothing needs support.
