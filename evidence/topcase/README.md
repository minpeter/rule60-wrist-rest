# HHKB top case — measurements and evidence

Source data behind [`build_topcase_draft.py`](../../build_topcase_draft.py) and the
checks behind the published files. All measurements were taken by the owner
on the stock Rule 60 V3 HHKB top case with a digital vernier caliper
(±0.01 mm display; hand-measurement error of a few hundredths is expected).

`Z_p` is the print-frame height: 0 at the top face (on the build plate),
increasing toward the skirt lip.

## Full-print fit results

| Version | Finding (owner) | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v6.2 | USB-C notch on the wrong side; outer back gasket tabs ~9.5 mm off their pockets ([0374](photos/IMG_0374.jpg), [0375](photos/IMG_0375.jpg)) | v7.0: the whole model was mirrored; plate X now mirrored into the underside print frame. Pocket offset was 10.12 mm. |
| v6.2 | Front-back length right, but the stock bottom case stood ~2.3 mm off at the pocket corners ([0370](photos/IMG_0370.jpg)–[0373](photos/IMG_0373.jpg)) | v7.1: pocket corners R5.0 → R2.0 (stock corner ≈ R5.0 − 2.3 = R2.7) |
| v6.2 | Stock USB-C notch smaller with rounded corners ([0378](photos/IMG_0378.jpg), [0379](photos/IMG_0379.jpg): stock top case lip-to-lip on the print) | v7.2: 12.8 wide, R1.5 closed-end corners; width scaled from the printed 14.2 mm notch (stock 12.6 / 12.75) |
| — | Outer corners looked too round against R2.0 inside (owner request) | v7.3: outer R8.0 → R4.85, concentric (uniform 2.85 mm wall) |
| v7.3 | Assembles; USB-C connector hit the notch until it was cut ~3 mm deeper by hand | v7.4: notch 5.7 → 8.7 mm deep from the lip; left half unchanged |
| v7.4 | Right half (the only changed part) printed; no major issues reported | — |

The plate outline and tab positions come from the `6095(gas)` drawing in
`rule60-v3.dwg` of [minjunkim0205/Hobby-CustomKeyboard @ ecf3575](https://github.com/minjunkim0205/Hobby-CustomKeyboard/tree/ecf3575e9fb844d32f57b42ce6f7f23f30294396/keyboards/housings/Rule60)
(file hashes in [dwg-source-manifest.json](analysis/dwg-source-manifest.json)).
The drawing is not redistributed.

## Photos

Original resolution and image data (decoded pixels identical to the camera
files). All metadata removed losslessly: EXIF (location, time, camera,
MakerNotes, thumbnail), XMP, JFIF and the embedded HDR gain-map image. Only
the orientation flag and the colour profile are kept so the photos display
upright and in their original colours.

| [0333](photos/IMG_0333.jpg)–[0337](photos/IMG_0337.jpg), [0340](photos/IMG_0340.jpg), [0341](photos/IMG_0341.jpg) | Caliper readings (table above) |
| [0370](photos/IMG_0370.jpg)–[0373](photos/IMG_0373.jpg) | v6.2 left half with the stock bottom case pushed in: stuck ~2.3 mm short at the R5.0 corners |
| [0374](photos/IMG_0374.jpg), [0375](photos/IMG_0375.jpg) | v6.2 left half with the gasket plate: outer back caps outside their pockets |
| [0378](photos/IMG_0378.jpg), [0379](photos/IMG_0379.jpg) | Stock top case on the v6.2 print, lip to lip: USB-C notch comparison |

The v4.6 coupon test (owner, 2026-10-28) confirmed joint positions, ball-catch
engagement and screw-hole size. It was a front corner, where the gasket tabs and
strikes are nearly symmetric, so it could not reveal the v6.2 mirror image.

| [../topcase-verification.json](../topcase-verification.json) | `verify_topcase.py` output on the exported halves |
| [../topcase-report.json](../topcase-report.json) | Build report: Z stack, pocket outlines, back seam, dovetails, USB-C notch |
| [checks/as-printed-check.json](checks/as-printed-check.json) | Same checks on both halves rebuilt at the printed layer heights, plan clearances to the stock parts, slicer estimates. One finding: the wedge-key tip bears after ~0.15 mm of its 0.20 mm vertical glue line. |
| [checks/seams-v7.4.png](checks/seams-v7.4.png) | Split line, back-seam plan at the BL strike, and sections through the 3 dovetails and the wedge key |

`as-printed-check.json` and the seam image were produced during the design
session, not by `build_topcase_draft.py`; regenerate them by hand if the
geometry changes.
